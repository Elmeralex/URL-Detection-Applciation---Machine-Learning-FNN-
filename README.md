# URL-Detection-Application---Machine-Learning-FNN-
URL Detection Application using Machine Learning (FNN)

## **Introduction**

The **URL Detection App** is an Android application developed using **Kotlin with Jetpack Compose** and **TensorFlow Lite**, designed to perform **on-device detection of malicious URLs and QR codes**.  
Its primary goal is to **protect users from phishing and malicious links** without requiring them to open or interact with suspicious URLs or QR codes.

The application offers two main input modes:
1. **Manual URL Entry** ‚Äì Users can type or paste a URL for analysis.  
2. **QR Code Scanning** ‚Äì Users can scan QR codes containing embedded links.

## **Model Overview**

The detection model is built using a **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)** ‚Äî a type of **multi-layer perceptron** implemented via the **Keras deep learning API**, and later converted into a **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)** format for efficient deployment on Android devices.

Before training, the raw URL dataset undergoes **feature engineering** and **text vectorization** to extract meaningful numerical representations suitable for neural network learning.

### **Feature Engineering**

Referring to the dataset methodology described in DOI: [10.17632/hx4m73v2sf.2](https://doi.org/10.17632/hx4m73v2sf.2), several static URL-based features are derived to capture key URL characteristics that can differentiate benign from malicious links.  

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| `url_length` | Total number of characters in the URL |
| `has_ip_address` | Binary flag (1/0): whether the URL contains an IP address |
| `dot_count` | Number of ‚Äú.‚Äù characters in the URL |
| `https_flag` | Binary flag (1/0): whether the URL uses HTTPS |
| `url_entropy` | Shannon entropy of the URL (higher values = more randomness) |
| `token_count` | Number of tokens/words in the URL |
| `subdomain_count` | Number of subdomains in the URL |
| `query_param_count` | Number of query parameters after ‚Äú?‚Äù |
| `tld_length` | Length of the top-level domain (e.g., ‚Äú.com‚Äù = 3) |
| `path_length` | Length of the path segment after the domain |
| `has_hyphen_in_domain` | Binary flag: whether the domain contains a hyphen (-) |
| `number_of_digits` | Count of numeric characters in the URL |
| `tld_popularity` | Binary flag: whether the TLD is a popular one |
| `suspicious_file_extension` | Binary flag: whether the URL ends with suspicious extensions (.exe, .zip, etc.) |
| `domain_name_length` | Length of the domain name |
| `percentage_numeric_chars` | Percentage of numeric characters in the URL |

These features collectively represent the **static characteristics of URLs**, allowing the model to infer suspicious structural patterns without needing live network requests or dynamic execution.

### **Text Vectorization Using TF-IDF**

In addition to the handcrafted statistical features, each URL string is also converted into a **numerical vector** using the **Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** technique.  

- The **TF-IDF vectorizer** operates on **character-level n-grams (3‚Äì5 characters)**.  
- This captures subtle textual patterns and obfuscation tactics used in phishing URLs (e.g., ‚Äúpaypa1‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpaypal‚Äù).  
- The resulting vectors (up to 5000 features) serve as the model‚Äôs **input layer**.

This hybrid of **statistical + TF-IDF features** enhances the model‚Äôs ability to generalize across unseen URLs.

### **Neural Network Architecture**

The final model architecture is a lightweight **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)** optimized for mobile inference.

| **Layer** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| Input Layer | Accepts TF-IDF feature vectors |
| Dense (64 units, ReLU) | Learns high-level URL representations |
| Dense (32 units, ReLU) | Extracts nonlinear patterns from encoded features |
| Dense (1 unit, Sigmoid) | Outputs probability of the URL being malicious |

The model is trained using **binary cross-entropy loss** and the **Adam optimizer**, with **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.  
After training, the model is converted to **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)** format for deployment in the Android app.

## **Dataset**

The model training and evaluation are based on the **Grambeddings Dataset**:  
üîó [https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/grambeddings-dataset/](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/grambeddings-dataset/)  

This dataset contains a balanced mix of **benign and phishing URLs**, allowing robust model generalization and accurate malicious URL detection.
